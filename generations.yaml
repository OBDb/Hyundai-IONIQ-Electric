    description: "The Hyundai IONIQ Electric was the battery electric variant of the first-generation IONIQ lineup, which uniquely offered three electrified powertrains on a single dedicated platform. Featuring aerodynamic styling with a closed grille, active air flaps, and a smooth underbody, it achieved an impressive drag coefficient of just 0.24. Initially equipped with a 28 kWh lithium-ion polymer battery providing approximately 124 miles of range, it received a significant update in 2019 with a larger 38.3 kWh battery extending range to around 170 miles. The electric motor produced 118 HP (88 kW) in the original version, increased to 134 HP (100 kW) in the updated model. The interior featured a driver-focused cockpit with a digital instrument cluster, touchscreen infotainment system, and distinctive copper-colored accents to differentiate it from hybrid variants. As Hyundai's first dedicated electric vehicle, the IONIQ Electric offered competitive efficiency and value, though its range was more modest than some competitors. The model was discontinued in 2022 as Hyundai transitioned to its dedicated E-GMP platform for EVs and established IONIQ as a separate electric sub-brand."
